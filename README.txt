This was a small project i worked on for about two weeks. This is a short platformer game including two levels, an enemy and of course, the player. 
The player has to navigate the platforms to reach the exit before his health is drained. The player starts with 10 health, and drops by 2 every second. 
To proceed, the player must collect gems, which increase his health by ten.. When his health is below 5, he cannot jump.
The player has 3 lives, and loses them by either contacting with the beetle and killing him, or running out of health. 
Once he has either died and run out of lives, or reached the exit, the player is left with a game over screen showing his score, which is the total of his health and the end of each level added together.
For added danger, the beetle also chases the player if the player runs in front of it.
The entire game was designed by myself, except the background image.
The game also includes music which was created by myself using the software "fruity loops"
